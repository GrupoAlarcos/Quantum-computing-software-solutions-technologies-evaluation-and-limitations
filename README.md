## Abstract
Context: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising field with the potential to revolutionize information processing and storage. Understanding its current state and research trajectory is crucial.
Objective: This study aims to map the current literature on quantum computing, identifying key trends and themes in technologies, algorithms, problems, evaluation parameters, and challenges.
Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted using the SCOPUS database, including all papers up to December 2023. Relevant articles were selected based on inclusion criteria, and a content analysis was performed to categorize and synthesize the findings.
Results: Information was gathered from 30 primary studies. Although some quantum algorithms and problems are well-known, most are not widely used in research. Gate-based quantum computing and IBM Quantum are prominent. There are no established measures for evaluating quantum software, and verification and validation processes are lacking. Many limitations and challenges persist in the field.
Conclusion: Research is needed to enhance the maturity of quantum computing. Adopting and adapting classical software engineering guidelines to quantum software engineering is crucial. Effective evaluation, testing, and validation of quantum solutions must be investigated, as what is not measured cannot be improved.

## What is this?
This repository contains the replication package of the systematic mapping study, as well as the PDF with two article appendices (Appendixes.pdf). The first appendix, Appendix A, includes a table presenting the articles reviewed, highlighting those that were selected. The second appendix, Appendix B, contains tables showing the frequency of occurrence of each term by research question, as well as the categorisation of terms within each question.

## How is the replication package structured?
This repository contains an Excel file (Replication package.xlsx) that includes the whole replication package.

## Replication package
The replication package is structured in multiple Excel pages:
- Scopus search results
- Selection abstract title
- Paper classification
- Data extraction
- RQ1 Analysis
- RQ2 Analysis
- RQ3 Analysis
- RQ4 Analysis
- RQ5 Analysis
- RQ6 Analysis
